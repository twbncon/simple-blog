    <article> <article-head> <h1>Plan, Block, Repeat</h1> <h2 class="text-none">Building game loops inspired by real-life activism.</h2> <elt-meta><elt-date>11 Sept 2025</elt-date> <elt-category><span>game design</span><span>community</span></elt-category></elt-meta> </article-head> <p>Games are built on loops, especially tabletop RPGs. But what happens when these same patterns appear in real life? This summer, I’ve been watching the French <strong>Bloquons tout</strong> (Let’s block everything) movement blossom. It’s a super-exciting transversal anti-capitalist grassroots movement that sprouted on social media and saw its first day of public action yesterday, September 10, 2025. At its core, it’s built around a <strong>Revolution loop</strong>.</p>
<p>I wasn’t in France yesterday, and followed the action on social media and in private activist discussion groups. But a few days ago, I had the chance to participate in a local section prep meeting for one of the political parties supporting the movement.</p>
<p>Foreign and local press talk mostly about the most spectacular actions, like demonstrations and blockades. But what characterizes the movement is the huge number of popular and spontaneous assemblies that took place all over the country, like the prep meeting I attended. Folks gathered in villages, <em>banlieues</em> (suburbs), neighborhoods, cities, and workplaces to discuss what actions they could collectively take to oppose the system, and what they could change in their daily lives to avoid using and reinforcing the tools of capital.</p>
<p>And the most exciting part is that despite the involvement of some major unions and political parties, the members of the movement (some of whom are involved in those unions and parties) want to keep its bottom-up structure.</p>
<p>In that, it is a true revolutionary movement.
In that, it echoes some revolutionary movements of the past.</p>
<p>I’m hopeful that this movement could lead to constructive changes, but admittedly, right now it’s impossible to predict its future, mostly because of its diffuse nature. But it’s likely that there will be more gatherings, assemblies, and discussions, leading to more actions.</p>
<p>Reflecting upon the buildup of the movement, the spontaneous organization of the actions, and the probable repetition of this process, I couldn’t help but notice this looks like a gaming loop. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not implying that political struggle is a game, but rather that games could help us build safe spaces in which to experiment with and theorize forms of action. They’re a way to communicate ideas about self-organization.</p>
<p>The simplified <strong>Revolution loop</strong> could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet with fellow citizens</li>
<li>List possible actions</li>
<li>Choose a handful of actions</li>
<li>Create work groups, one for each action</li>
<li>Do the actions</li>
<li>Start over</li>
</ul>
<p>The game could even offer some granularity for each step, with dedicated tables. For example:</p>
<p><em>Meet with fellow citizens</em>, could become the question
<em>Who are you meeting with?</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Neighbors</li>
<li>Co-workers</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Sports team</li>
<li>Library club</li>
<li>Church</li>
</ol>
<p>This seems like a perfect fit for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/build-a-better-world-ttrpg-jam">Build a Better World RPG Jam</a> that is running right now, and for a few more days. I’m working on a simple one-page framework for this <strong>Revolution Loop</strong> for the jam, I’ll try and finish it before the jam ends. I’d love to hear what actions or tables you would add. Hop on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/37XBQVr7eP">server</a> and let me know.</p> </article>
